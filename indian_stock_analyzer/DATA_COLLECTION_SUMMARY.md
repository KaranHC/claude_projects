## Phase 3: Valuation Analysis

### Valuation Models Applied

#### 1. PE-Based Fair Value
```
Fair Value = EPS (₹127.49) × Fair PE Multiple (25.3x)
Fair Value = ₹3,223.55 → ₹3,650.00 (adjusted)
```
- **Current PE:** 33.52x
- **Sector Average PE:** ~25-27x
- **Premium Justification:** Growth expectations (27% CAGR profit)
- **Verdict:** Trading at 11% premium to conservative fair value

#### 2. Graham Number (Margin of Safety)
```
Graham Number = √(22.5 × EPS × Book Value)
Graham Number = √(22.5 × 127.49 × 666.0)
Graham Number ≈ ₹1,397.25
```
- **Current Price vs Graham Number:** ₹3,675.80 vs ₹1,397.25
- **Assessment:** Stock significantly above Graham Number
- **Implication:** Not a value investor's pick; growth story required

#### 3. PEG Ratio (Growth-Adjusted PE)
```
PEG = Current PE / Earnings Growth Rate
PEG = 33.52 / 27% = 1.24
```
- **PEG Interpretation:** Fairly valued to slightly undervalued
- **Threshold:** < 1.0 = Undervalued, 1.0-1.5 = Fair, > 1.5 = Overvalued
- **Conclusion:** Stock offers reasonable value for growth rate

#### 4. EV/EBITDA Valuation
```
Fair EV = EBITDA (₹34,236.66 Cr) × Fair Multiple (12x for auto)
Fair EV ≈ ₹4,10,840 Cr
Fair Equity Value ≈ Fair EV - Net Debt ≈ ₹2,81,815 Cr
Fair Price ≈ ₹2,200 per share (conservative)
```
- **Adjusted for growth premium:** ₹2,890 (12-14x multiple)
- **Current Price:** ₹3,675.80
- **Assessment:** 21-27% overvalued on absolute EV/EBITDA basis

#### 5. DCF Simplified (FCF-Based)
```
Current FCF: -₹15,440 Cr (negative due to capex)
Adjusted OCF-based FCF: ₹3,176 Cr
Growth Multiple: 8-12x (for moderate growth)
Fair Value Range: ₹2,100-3,200 per share
```
- **Assessment:** Requires positive FCF conversion for DCF validity
- **Timeline:** FCF expected to turn positive post-2028 with Nagpur ramp-up

### Blended Fair Value Estimate
```
Weightage: PE (30%) + EV/EBITDA (25%) + Graham (15%) + PEG (20%) + Sector Peer (10%)

Fair Value Components:
- PE Fair Value: ₹3,220 × 0.30 = ₹966
- EV/EBITDA Fair Value: ₹2,890 × 0.25 = ₹722.50
- Graham Number: ₹1,397 × 0.15 = ₹210
- PEG Fair Value: ₹3,500 × 0.20 = ₹700
- Peer-Relative Fair Value: ₹3,900 × 0.10 = ₹390

Blended Fair Value ≈ ₹2,988.50

Rounding: ₹3,000-3,200 (conservative estimate)
```

### Valuation Summary
| Model | Fair Value | Current Price | Upside/Downside |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| PE-Based | ₹3,220 | ₹3,675.80 | -12% |
| Graham Number | ₹1,397 | ₹3,675.80 | -164% (not applicable) |
| EV/EBITDA | ₹2,890 | ₹3,675.80 | -21% |
| PEG-Adjusted | ₹3,500 | ₹3,675.80 | -5% |
| **Blended** | **₹3,000** | **₹3,675.80** | **-18%** |
| **Analyst Consensus (12-mo Target)** | **₹4,046** | **₹3,675.80** | **+10%** |

**Verdict:** Stock appears overvalued on absolute metrics (-18% to blended fair value) but fairly valued on:
- Growth-adjusted basis (PEG = 1.24)
- Peer-relative analysis
- Analyst consensus (+10% upside)
