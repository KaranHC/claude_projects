## Investment Recommendation Matrix

### For Different Investor Profiles

#### Growth Investors
**Recommendation**: AVOID
**Reason**: 5.95% revenue CAGR insufficient for growth mandate

**Fair Value**: ₹1,976; Current Price ₹2,146 (8% overvalued)
**Wait Signal**: Analyst downgrades to 'Strong Sell' or price correction

#### Income Investors

**Risk**: Dividend payout = 106% earnings (unsustainable if profit declines)
**Action**: Monitor Q4 FY26 profit trend before buying

#### Quality/Dividend Growth Investors
**Recommendation**: AVOID NEW PURCHASES
**Reason**: Past dividend growth not sustainable at current profit trajectory
**Concern**: Might need to cut dividend if volume pressures persist
**Action**: Wait for profit stabilization confirmation
