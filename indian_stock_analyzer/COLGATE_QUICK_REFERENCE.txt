SHORT TERM (0-3 months):
  Monitor: Q4 FY26 results (May 21, 2026)
  Action: Wait for clarity on volume trends

MEDIUM TERM (3-6 months):
  Monitor: Dividend policy, analyst downgrades, tax appeal
  Action: Buy only if price drops to ₹1,800-₹1,850

  Monitor: Volume recovery signs, new product success, market share
  Action: Build position only after confirmed recovery

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

COLGATE-PALMOLIVE IS:
  • A quality company (fortress balance sheet, market leadership)
  • At the wrong price (premium valuation, weak growth)
  • Facing real challenges (volume pressures, market saturation)
  • With uncertain outlook (no clear recovery catalyst)

BEST STRATEGY:
  1. Current holders: Take profits above ₹2,150
  2. Prospective buyers: Wait for ₹1,800-₹1,900 entry
  3. Dividend seekers: Look for higher-yielding alternatives
  4. Growth investors: Avoid (only 6% growth)

NEXT CRITICAL DATE: May 21, 2026 (Q4 FY26 Results)
  → Will determine if volume stabilization has begun
  → Will show if margin compression will continue
  → Will clarify FY27 profit outlook
