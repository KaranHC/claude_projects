# Risk Management & Position Sizing Skill

## Overview
This skill provides quantitative risk assessment beyond simple stop-loss levels. It covers drawdown analysis, position sizing methodologies, and scenario modeling — transforming a stock recommendation into an actionable trade plan with defined risk parameters.

## Before Analysis — MANDATORY
Read `risk-models.md` for:
- Value at Risk (VaR) estimation from available data
- Maximum drawdown analysis
- Beta and volatility assessment
- Kelly Criterion and position sizing

Read `scenario-analysis.md` for:
- Bull/Base/Bear case modeling
- Stress test methodology
- Risk-reward ratio optimization
- Portfolio context and correlation

## Key Principles
1. Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on a single trade
2. Risk-reward ratio should be at least 1:2 (prefer 1:3)
3. Account for both systematic (market) and unsystematic (company) risk
4. Indian market-specific risks: currency, regulatory, FII flow dependency
5. Position size should decrease as conviction decreases
