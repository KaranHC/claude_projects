# Chart Pattern Recognition Skill

## Overview
This skill provides a systematic framework for identifying chart patterns from available price data. While full candlestick charts require OHLC history, meaningful pattern analysis is possible from current price, 52-week range, and volume data combined with price action context.

## Before Analysis — MANDATORY
Read `pattern-catalog.md` for:
- Major reversal and continuation patterns
- Identification criteria from limited data
- Probability and target calculation methods

Read `candlestick-patterns.md` for:
- Key single and multi-candle patterns
- Contextual significance (where in trend they appear)
- Indian market applicability notes

## Key Principles
1. Patterns are probabilistic, not deterministic — always use stop losses
2. Volume confirmation increases pattern reliability by 30-50%
3. Patterns on higher timeframes (weekly/monthly) are more reliable
4. Always consider the broader trend context (pattern within trend)
5. Indian market patterns follow global TA principles but with higher volatility
6. Support/resistance at round numbers (100s, 500s, 1000s) are stronger in India due to retail behavior
