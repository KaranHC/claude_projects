# Peer Comparison & Sector Analysis Skill

## Overview
This skill enables identification of sector peers and systematic comparison of key metrics, providing relative valuation context that is critical for investment decisions. A stock is never cheap or expensive in isolation — only relative to its peers.

## Key Principles
1. Compare like-with-like (same sector, similar market cap tier)
2. Use at least 3-5 peers for meaningful comparison
3. Consider business model differences when interpreting ratios
4. Time-normalize metrics (trailing 12 months preferred)
5. Flag outliers — they indicate either opportunity or risk
